# Editable development dependencies.  -*- conf -*-
#
# Add direct development, test, and documentation dependencies here, as well
# as implicit dev dependencies with constrained versions. Do not add tox or
# its plugins here; instead, put those in tox.in. Do not add pre-commit here;
# it is handled by the top-level Makefile.
#
# After editing, update requirements/dev.txt by running:
#     make update-deps
