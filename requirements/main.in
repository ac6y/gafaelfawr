# Editable runtime dependencies (equivalent to install_requires)
# Add direct runtime dependencies here, as well as implicit dependencies
# with constrained versions.
#
# After editing, update requirements/main.txt by running:
#     make update-deps

# These three dependencies are for aiohttp.  We would prefer to depend on
# aiohttp[speedups], but that pulls in brotlipy, and we were having
# compilation difficulties with it.
