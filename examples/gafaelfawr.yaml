# Example configuration file for Gafaelfawr.
#
# The recommended installation method is to use the Helm chart, which will
# generate this file based on Helm values as a ConfigMap.  However, this
# example may be useful if you need to modify the Helm chart or
# hand-generate the documentation.
#
# All example.com values in this example should be changed to the domain
# name under which you're running Gafaelfawr.

  # To get scopes based on GitHub team membership, replace <org> with the

  # in that organization.  (This may be truncated for long names; see the
