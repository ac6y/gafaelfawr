# Custom PostgreSQL configuration file for tests.
#
# This file is bind-mounted into the postgres container by tox-docker when
# running tests.  It disables safety measures in the database storage so that
# tests will run faster.  This reduces the time it takes to execute the test
# suite by about 10%.
