### New features

- Added new `gafaelfawr update-schema` command that creates the database if necessary and otherwise applies any needed Alembic migrations.
- Added new `gafaelfawr validate-schema` command that exits non-zero if the database has not been initialized or if the schema is not up-to-date.
