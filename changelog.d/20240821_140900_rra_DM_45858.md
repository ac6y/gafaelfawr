### New features

- `GafaelfawrIngress` now accepts a `service` parameter at the top level of the configuration and uses that to tag authentication metrics by service. This corresponds to the `service` query parameter to the `/auth` route. If `delegate_to` is also set (`config.delegate.internal.service` in `GafaelfawrIngress`), it must match the value of `service`. This parameter is currently optional but will eventually become mandatory.
