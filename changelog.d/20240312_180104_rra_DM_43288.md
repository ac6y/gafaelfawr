### New features

- Add a health check internal route, `/health`, which is available only inside the Kubernetes cluster. Check that the database, Redis, and (if configured) LDAP and Firestore connections are all working. Use that as a liveness check so that Kubernetes will restart Gafaelfawr if any of those connection pools are no longer working.
