### Bug fixes

- Always mask all headers to which Gafaelfawr gives special meaning when passing requests to a service downstream of a `GafaelfawrIngress`, instead of only masking the ones Gafaelfawr might set in that configuration. This ensures that no service behind a `GafaelfawrIngress` sees, e.g., `X-Auth-Request-User` unless it truly is authenticated by Gafaelfawr.
