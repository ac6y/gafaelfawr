### New features

- An ingress may now be restricted to a specific user by setting the `username` attribute in the `config` section of a `GafaelfawrIngress`, or the corresponding `username` query parameter to the `/auth` route. Any other user will receive a 403 error. The scope requiremments must also still be met.
