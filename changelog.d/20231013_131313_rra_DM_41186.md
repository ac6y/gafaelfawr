### New features

- Added new `/auth/cadc/userinfo` route, which accepts a Gafaelfawr token and returns user metadata in the format expected by the CADC authentication code. This route is expected to be temporary and will be moved into the main token API once we decide how to handle uniqueness of the `sub` claim. It is therefore not currently documented outside of the autogenerated API documentation.
