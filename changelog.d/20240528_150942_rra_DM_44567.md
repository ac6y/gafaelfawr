### Other changes

- Honor the `POSTGRES_5432_TCP_PORT`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `REDIS_6379_TCP_PORT`, and `REDIS_HOST` environment variables if they are set and override the configured database URL and Redis URL with them. This is required to work with the latest version of tox-docker for testing and development. These environment variables are not used inside a Phalanx deployment.
