### New features

- Add support for exporting metrics to an OpenTelemetry collector. The initial set of metrics is limited to login metrics, token delegation, and counts of active sessions and user tokens.

### Bug fixes

- Reset login state after an error so that any subsequent authentication attempt will generate a new, random state parameter.
