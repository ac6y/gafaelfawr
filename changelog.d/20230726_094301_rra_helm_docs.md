### New features

- To configure Gafaelfawr to use the cluster-internal PostgreSQL service, use the Helm chart setting `config.internalDatabase` rather than setting an explicit URL. Setting `config.databaseUrl` to the internal PostgreSQL URL will still work for existing deployments, but using `config.internalDatabase` instead will be required in the future for correct secrets management.
- Gafaelfawr can now listen on additional hostnames specified by setting `ingress.additionalHosts` in the Helm configuration. Only token authentication will be supported for ingresses using those hostnames; interactive browser authentication will not work.
