### New features

- Add a health check for the Kubernetes operator that tests the Kopf infrastructure as well as the database and Redis connections. Use that as a liveness check to restart the operator if the health check starts failing.

### Bug fixes

- Ensure that only one Gafaelfawr operator pod is running at a time.
- Add Kubernetes resource requests and limits for the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sidecar container.
