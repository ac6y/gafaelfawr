### New features

- Gafaelfawr now supports the common LDAP configuration of recording group membership by full user DN rather than only username. Set `group_search_by_dn` to search for the user by full DN in the group tree. This requires LDAP also be used for user metadata.

### Other changes

- Log the full contents of the upstream OIDC token before token verification if debug logging is enabled.
