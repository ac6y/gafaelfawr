### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Replace `config.tokenLifetimeMinutes` with `config.tokenLifetime`, which accepts one or more time intervals with suffixes `w`, `d`, `h`, `m`, and `s` for weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.
- Change the default of `config.cilogon.usernameClaim` to `username`. This is what we use for all current CILogon integrations.
- Change the default of `config.ldap.groupSearchByDn` to true. To preserve the previous behavior of searching by the bare username, this setting must be explicitly set to false.
- Support for `config.loglevel` in Helm values has been dropped. Use `config.logLevel` instead (note the capital `L`).

### New features

- Support overriding the HTTP authentication realm for `WWW-Authenticate` challenges by setting `config.realm`.
- Support overriding the OpenID Connect issuer (`iss` claim) and key ID (`kid` claim) for the internal OpenID Connect server by setting `config.oidcServer.issuer` and `config.oidcServer.kid`, respectively.

### Other changes

- Move the `docker-compose.yaml` file, now used only for creating Alembic migrations, into the `alembic` subdirectory and update the documentation for creating new Alembic migraitons accordingly.
