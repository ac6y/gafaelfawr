### Backwards-incompatible changes

- When acting as an OpenID Connect server, Gafaelfawr no longer exposes all claims by default. Instead, it now honors the `scope` parameter in the request, which must include `openid` and may include `profile` and `email`.
- Require the `oidcServer.issuer` configuration setting use the `https` scheme, since this is required by the OpenID Connect 1.0 specification.
- Set the `aud` claim in OpenID Connect ID tokens issued by Gafaelfawr to the client ID of the requesting client instead of a fixed audience used for all tokens.
- OpenID Connect ID tokens issued by Gafaelfawr now inherit their expiration time from the underlying Gafaelfawr token used as the authentication basis for the ID token. Previously, OpenID Connect ID tokens would receive the full default lifetime even when issued on the basis of Gafaelfawr tokens that were about to expire.

### Bug fixes

- Include the scope used to issue the ID token in the reply from the OpenID Connect server token endpoint.
- In the response from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, declare that the only supported response mode of the OpenID Connect server is `query`.
