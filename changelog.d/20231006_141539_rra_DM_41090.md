### New features

- Gafaelfawr now imposes a maximum run time and retention duration for its periodic maintenance jobs. These can be adjusted with the new `config.maintenance.deadlineSeconds` and `config.maintenance.cleanupSeconds` Helm settings.
- All Gafaelfawr pods now set Kubernetes resource requests and limits. The requests match the consumption of a lightly-loaded deployment using OpenID Connect and LDAP, and the limits should be generous. These can be adjusted using Helm chart values.
