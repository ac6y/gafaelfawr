### New features

- Add a new `rubin` scope for the OpenID Connect server that, if requested, provides a `data_rights` claim listing the data releases to which the user has rights. Add a new `config.oidcServer.dataRightsMapping` configuration option that is used to determine that list of data releases from a user's group memberships.
