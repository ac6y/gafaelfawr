### Backwards-incompatible changes

- In the reply to a successful OpenID Connect authentication, return a Gafaelfawr token of a new `oidc` type as the access token instead of a copy of the ID token. This `oidc` token will be marked as a child token of the underlying Gafaelfawr token used to authenticate the OpenID Connect login, which means it will automatically be revoked if the user logs out.
- Only accept Gafaelfawr tokens of the `oidc` type for the OpenID Connect server userinfo endpoint.
- Return only userinfo claims from the OpenID Connect server userinfo endpoint instead of the full set of claims that would go into an ID token. Currently, the userinfo claims are not filtered based on the requested scopes; all available userinfo claims are returned.
