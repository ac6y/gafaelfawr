### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Remove the `/auth/analyze` route. This was an old way for a user to see information about their token that has been deprecated for many releases. The output used the old JWT token claim format and was missing a great deal of useful information. `/auth/api/v1/user-info` and `/auth/api/v1/token-info` should be used instead.
