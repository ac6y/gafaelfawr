### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Drop support for getting user metadata from OpenID Connect token claims. LDAP, for both user metadata and group membership, is now required when using an OpenID Connect authentication, including CILogon.
- Drop support for LDAP groups without GIDs. Either Firestore GID assignment must be enabled or LDAP must contain a GID for each group. Groups without GIDs in LDAP will be ignored if Firestore is not enabled.
- Retrieval of the UID and primary GID from LDAP is now enabled by default unless Firestore is enabled.
